1. `archiso.txt` provides a link to my custom arch installation iso, which behaves exactly like the official one except that it provides wireless acess for macbook(or other laptops with broadcom network controller). It is created with `archiso` within arch(using kernel 4.12.8-1-ARCH), adding `dkms` and `broadcom-wl-dkms`.     
*Story*: I search arch wiki and find that macbook air doesn't have wifi out of box, so I copy the necessary packages from cache on another arch machine. Yet upon installing them, pacman warns me that the installation usb media didn't have enough free space. I am furious and create my own iso.   
  
2. Includes example tests for Chinese latex(xelatex) and Qt & java environment.  

3. XX-Net config.    

4. configs for xfce4-terminal, xterm, vim.  

5. My arch installation record and useful scripts(ex. on startup).
